This year's theme for Technica, a hackathon held at University of Maryland for women and non-binary participants, 
was "Go Beyond." For this reason our team brainstormed various ideas on an iOS application we could create that could
provide some sort of service to a community; i.e something that would go beyond and improve quality of living, connection, or collaboration in some way. Some of our initial ideas were centered on an app that allowed students 
to share their class notes with eachother for people that do not have access to good education systems, as well as an 
app that notified people of events with free/discounted food and other items within a certain radius of their location.

While we brainstormed quite a few categories for our app, we actually pivoted more towards social good in the context of the environment. We finally settled on an app that focused on the environment and a community's work to make their neighborhoods better. We recognized that many people want to do something to better their neighborhood or community, but it's hard to actually go out and do these things without having help from other people in the community. Thus, our app is a project creater and goal tracker for members of the community, who can see, organize, and join relevant initiatives to them. This idea would be useful in many ways, from helping people organize together to make their community more green, to allowing politicians or larger social groups to track their state/county's eco-friendliness. People in different communities would be able to create & manage goals and track their own progress.

Other features of this app would also include: areas of concern in the community that can be reported to the app by taking pictures or videos, government-funded initiatives in the area, and people would be able to post initiatives and gain support 
from those who want to collaborate on projects, but havenâ€™t been able to garner enough resources in the past.
 
The IOS app is coded using Swift. The layout of the app is split into further subsections, including an Explore page, a My Goals Page and a Community Page. When you log into the app, you are taken to the Community page, where you are able to see progress and track any new updates to the projects you are a member of.

For the My Goals page, we plan to use the user's Google Calendar API to integrate a specific calendar for the app that they would be able to add hours, meetings, and volunteer work too. We would also have the app calculate the user's individual goal progress (weekly, monthly etc.), recieving updates on progress or other intiatives happening nearby. Badge icons that the user can unlock would provide extra initiative to take part.

The Explore page would incorporate a supervised Machine Learning technique to predict or recommend other projects in the community based on the user's habits, such as proximity, size, availability, tags, and more. The algorithm would use online learning, as the user changes their preferences and habits and as a result the app constantly recieves new data from its users and uses this data to create a prediction tailored to the user. Additionally, it would list any new government-funded initiatives in the area.

Below are the graphics we created that represent each page of the app.
