# Technica2019
MLH Hackathon Project, Fall 2019, Technica @ UMD

This year's theme for Technica, a hackathon held at University of Maryland for women and non-binary participants, 
was "Go Beyond." For this reason our team brainstormed various ideas on an IOS application we could create that could
provide some sort of service to a community. Some of our initial ideas were centered on an app that allowed students 
to share their class notes with eachother for people that do not have access to good education systems, as well as an 
app that notified people of events with free/discounted food and other items within a certain radius of their location.

We finally settled on an app that focused on the environment and a community's carbon footprint. Like Waze: users would input 
some sort of data (i.e air pollution, water wastage statistics) so that other users are aware and can avoid certain areas at 
certain times of day. This idea would be useful in many ways, from helping people with severe medical conditions, to allowing 
politicians or larger social groups to track their state/county's eco-friendliness. People in different communities would be able to create & manage goals and tracking their own progress.

Other features of this app would also include: areas of concern in the community that can be reported to the app by taking pictures or videos, government-funded initiatives in their area, and people would be able to post initiatives and gain support 
from those who want to collaborate on initiatives, but havenâ€™t been able to garner enough resources in the past.
 
The IOS app is coded using Swift. The layout of the app is split into further subsections, including an Explore page. a My Goals Page and a Community Page.
For the My Goals page, We plan to include api requests for the user's google calender. We would also have the app
calculate the user's goal progress (weekly, monthly etc.) and the user would also recieve updates on progress or other intiatives happening nearby. 
The Explore page would incorporate the Machine Learning technique of Supervised Learning to predict or reccomend other projects in the community based on the user's habits. The algorithm would be Online Learning,as the app constantly recieves new data from its users and uses this data to create a prediction tailored to the user.
